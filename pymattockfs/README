In order to run pymattockfs, you should first do the following.

* Create a user named 'mattockfs' part of the 'fuse' group and owning /var/mattock

  sudo useradd mattockfs -g fuse -d /var/mattock -m

After that, you may start the file-system and make it run as the new user:

  sudo su mattockfs -c './pymattockfs.py -o allow_other'

Or if you suspect there to be bugs (MattockFS is currently still in alpha testing):
 
  sudo su mattockfs -c './pymattockfs.py -o allow_other -f'

The file-system will be mounted under /var/mattock/mnt/0 and can be unmounted using:

  sudo su mattockfs -c 'fusermount -u /var/mattock/mnt/0'
