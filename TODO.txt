* Extend tests for job picking strategies (refcount_stack 56%)
* Add test for just out of range carvpath (repository 68%)
* Make test scripts output OK/FAIL for tests on (un)expected results 
    (instead of text strings that only Rob knows how to parse for success)
* Code cleanup.

Todo for second beta:
* Test for load-balancing related module+job processing.
* Unified logging facility.
* Refactor sorting to picking.
