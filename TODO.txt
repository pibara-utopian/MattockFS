* Record process executable and user in provenance log.
* Refactor sorting to picking.
* Restore state from journal.
* Look into packaging issues (pip?/apt?)

After second beta:
* Port the base API to C++
* Port the base API to Perl
* Port the base API to NodeJs
* Port the base API to Rust
* Port MattockFS to C++ and/or make Python version work with Blake2bp
