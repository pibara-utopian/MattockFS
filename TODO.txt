TODO for first beta:
* Look into packaging issued (pip?/apt?/docker?)

Possibly todo before we go into paper writing mode for a while :

* Example code with libtsk (semi mmls module)


==== There will be a long pause in development after above is done,
==== I'll be working on my paper for a few months.

Todo after first beta:
* Unified logging facility.
* Refactor sorting to picking.
* Restore state from journal.
* Port the base API to C++
* Port the base API to Perl
* Port the base API to NodeJs
* Port the base API to Rust
* Port MattockFS to C++ and/or make Python version work with Blake2bp
