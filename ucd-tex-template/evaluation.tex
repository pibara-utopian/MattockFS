\chapter{Evaluation and Discussion of results}
\noindent 
What part of the problem has been solved/ What parts remain to be solved? Are the results practically useful, and under what circumstances? if your research problem has already been addressed by other researchers but in a different way, how do your results compare to the alternative approaches and results (in what ways your approach and results are better, and in what ways are they worse?)
