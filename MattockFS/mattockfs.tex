\chapter{MattockFS: A CarvFS successor.}
In this appendix we describe the functionality and design of a new user-space file-system. MattockFS is meant to be a successor to the user space file-system named CarvFS that was released by the Dutch National Police in 2010 to act as an annotation based pseudo file-system aimed at facilitating zero-storage carving to the OCFA forensic framework. While CarvFS was retrofitted to work with OCFA, we aim to create a new user-space file-systemed modeled partially after CarvFS that should act as the potential foundation of new message passing oriented forensic framework. We envission that MattockFS, together with a serialization library and message bus technology could form the foundation for a yet ficticious future \emph{Mattock} forensic framework, loosely modeled after the OCFA forensic framework. The aim is to implement as much as is logical and sensible of the main aspects of disk-cache optimization techniques into this user space file-system. This should include facilities for querying throttling relevant information, facilities for keeping track of \emph{active} CarvPaths, facilities for marking expected read-access patterns for a given CarvPath and for marking a CarvPath as no longer needed. Also it shall include facilities for opportunistic hashing. Finaly, while in OCFA, the concept of a growing archive was implemented by allowing a data-generating module access to the raw data-file underlying the file-system, in MattockFS we shall opt to implement this trough a file-system layer.
